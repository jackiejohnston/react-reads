# MyReads

This is a bookshelf app built in React that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Step 1: Download

```
$  git clone git@github.com:jackiejohnston/react-reads.git
```

## Step 2: Install

You will first need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

```
$  npm install
```

## Step 3: Run

```
$  npm start
```

## Step 4: Interact

Note: The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
